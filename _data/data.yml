        04/2018-10/2019, A map for navigating users to their nearest charge station
        (included several branches) for new energy cars in China. I developed
        it mainly because it was difficult to find charges after I bought an
        electronic car. It once ranked top in BAIDU search results for several 
        months before I finally couldn't afford the server any longer. I open-source 
        it on Github.
