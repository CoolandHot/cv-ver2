# Profile
profile: |
   I discovered my interest in data science at work and __plan a 
   PhD__ in this direction by pursuing an MSc degree in Data Science 
   at the University of Sydney. I'm so fascinated by tackling real-world 
   problems with Machine Learning. To gain more research experience for applying 
   for a PhD, I have been working as a research assistant at the University of 
   Sydney (remotely, 08/2021-02/2022) and Zhejiang University (in person, 02/2022-present). 
   All projects involve machine learning model development to some extent. 
   
   My experience in the machine learning area is in a broad field, 
   thus I would like to focus on one or two specific areas in the PhD study.
